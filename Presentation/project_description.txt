	Unity with ARKit2 Plugin

Gameplay Description:
We want to develop a simple multiplayer AR game using the ARKit2 unity plugin.
With the new ARKit2 you can create shared AR experiences, meaning that both players see the same AR environment and both can interact with it.
Check out the video examples on this website: https://www.apple.com/at/newsroom/2018/06/apple-unveils-arkit-2/?videoid=0e9ddba360be9dd77ac4881ea2fa6cdb

We want to start by developing a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe and after evaluating how complicated the AR multiplayer implementation will be, we will decide if we develop a more sophisticated game (e.g. Air Hockey, Chess, ...).

The game will run on all ARKit2 compatible devices (iPhone 6s and newer, iPad 2017 and newer, min. iOS 12.0).
